<p>On behalf of the Vancouver Cake Society, we welcome your application to be an instructor at Cake. Love. 2014!  It is our goal to become one of the premier sugar art and cake decorating events in the Pacific Northwest.  This event will be held, October 3-5, 2014, in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>

<p>
    Here are some specifics you will need to know before you commit:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You must be in Vancouver in Thursday, October 2, 2014.  There will be a mandatory instructor orientation meeting at 6pm on the 2nd.
    </li>
    <li>You will be responsible to arrange for your transportation to and from the conference, the Society will take care of your room charge for Thursday to Saturday nights.  Additional nights are your responsibility.</li>

    <li>
        You may schedule a participation (hands-on) class or a demonstration class.  If you would like to offer a demonstration class, we ask that you propose no more than 1 such class.
    </li>
    <li>We ask that you propose classes that are different than what you might be offering at other decorating conferences in North America, though some repeats are acceptable (especially for your more popular classes).</li>

    <li>
        We will try our hardest to arrange for any special equipment, but cannot guarantee its availability.  We will advise in advance if this is an issue.
    </li>
    <li>
        Demonstration classes must be limited to 2 hours in length.
    </li>
    <li>Participation classes may be offered in two hour increments.  If a class requires more than one 2 hour block, you may request it to be offered over a combined series of blocks (either on the same day or on different days – if drying time is required).</li>

    <li>The participation classrooms will accommodate up to 20 participants with tables and chairs furnished, depending on the room size.  There are a few rooms which are designed for fewer students and a few for more.</li>

    <li>Instructors will be allowed to sell only those products that are required to complete a class, and only during their class time.  If you have additional items you would like to sell, we will have a Vendor Room for your use (at a special rate).</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to properly prepare a class schedule and start to accept registrations, it is important that all of the information requested from you be sent in on or before February ***, 2014.  Due to space availability we will only be able to accept 10  instructors for this conference.  As such, it is extremely important that you submit your completed application as soon as possible! Applications will be assessed based on a combination of the types of classes offered (to ensure good variety and range of skill level) as well as order of receipt of all necessary information.</p>

<p>A sample of your hands on class or demo project should be on display in our registration area by Thursday evening, October 2, 2014. We will allow on-site registration for any classes that are not full, unless you request otherwise before the start of the conference.</p>

<p>
    Registration for all of our classes and demos will be done electronically through our website.
</p>
<p>Our website will contain information about you and your classes.  These are opportunities to sell yourself and your classes.  In this case, a picture truly is worth a 1000 words.  Please make sure that all pictures sent in clearly show the subject matter, are in focus, are free of distracting backgrounds and are of the ACTUAL project to be completed by students.  Past experience has shown that students get quite upset when the class project and the associated picture are not the same thing (ie. Using an “inspiration” picture is not recommended).  It is also important that your class descriptions are well written.  Please have someone proofread them.</p>

<p>If you request a Vendor Table, our Vendor Committee will send out information to you in the near future.</p>

<p>We are very excited to be holding Cake. Love. 2014. in such a beautiful and exciting location, If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact myself, by email, at jennifer@cakeloveyvr.com.</p>
